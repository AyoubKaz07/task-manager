# task-manager
Thanks to John Smilga from the projects course, the frontend was a starter to the project
Learned some basic stuff like middlewares, using a database (MongoDB with mongoose), handlers
and most importantly handling routes with some organized code.
I hate frontend. 
to test it out:
- add your MongoDB database to `.env` file
- of course don't forget to install dependencies with `npm install` 
- also the routes can be found in `tasks.js` if you want to test them
Again... Until i learn deploying.
